# Web-Scraper
This is a basic web scraper used to grab company and website information from Google Maps to later compile into my 100 Hours project -- coming soon!

**Link to project:** Coming soon!



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript

This is build with Node.js using the Puppeteer module to navigate to a webpage and grab the requested data. It will grab this data and post it to  a MongoDB database associated with a specific account, to be used in my full stack web application FreelanceFinder

## Optimizations

Currently none, as this is still the beginning of the project and the goal is getting it functioning first. Once it is fully functioning, optimization will begin. The next step of the project is to make it be able to automatically search a certain place, and be able to navigate many results as opposd to a single direct link. 


## Lessons Learned:

The basics of web scraping and navigating the DOM of a complicated website such as Google Maps that uses JavaScript to render the information I am looking for has been an interesting challenge to start.
